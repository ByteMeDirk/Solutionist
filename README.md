# Solutionist

A modern, collaborative, developer-focused solution-sharing platform inspired by StackOverflow but with a gist-like solutions repository.

- User authentication and profiles
- Solution posting with markdown and code highlighting
- Tagging and categorization system
- Commenting and discussion threads
- Voting and reputation system
- Search functionality
