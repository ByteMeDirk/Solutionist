## Phase-Based, Scalable Django Project Plan for "Solutionist"

Below is a detailed, multi-phase plan and prompt breakdown for your coding agent to create *Solutionist* — a modern,
collaborative, developer-focused solution-sharing platform inspired by StackOverflow but with a gist-like solutions
repository. These prompts are verbose and goal-oriented, following scalable Django design standards, code quality, and
deployment best practices. **Each phase is modular and focused to avoid overwhelming the agent.**

### Phase 1: Initial Project & Environment Setup

**Objective:** Establish a robust, scalable Django project foundation and code quality framework.

- Create a new Django project named `solutionist` using Poetry as the dependency manager.
- Set up a monorepo trunk or develop branch structure.
- Install and configure the following tools:
    - **Poetry** for dependency management.
    - **Black**, **isort**, **flake8** for code formatting and linting.
    - **pytest** and Django's unittest for testing.
    - **pre-commit** hooks for code quality.
- Initialize Git repository with a `.gitignore` tailored for Django.
- Configure initial GitHub Actions workflows for:
    - Linting
    - Running tests (pytest/unittest)
    - Build checks (static analysis)
- Add an initial `README.md` outlining project vision and setup instructions.

### Phase 2: Core App & Theme Integration

**Objective:** Architect main Django apps, integrate Bootstrap 5, and implement base site theming (purple & black
theme).

- Create modular Django apps:
    - `users`: Handles user registration, authentication, profiles.
    - `solutions`: For posting, editing, and versioning solutions.
    - `tags`: For advanced topic tagging.
    - `comments`: For user comments on solutions.
    - (`core` for utilities and shared logic if needed.)
- Set up Bootstrap 5 integration and SCSS/CSS theming with purple/black as main colors.
- Develop a base template (HTML) structure using Bootstrap, following DRY principles and Django template inheritance.
- Set up static and media file handling.
- Implement 404/500 and general error templates matching the chosen theme.

### Phase 3: User Management & Profiles

**Objective:** Build secure, rich user management with profile customization and social features.

- Implement registration, login, logout, and account deletion with Django's auth system.
- Create user profile models:
    - Fields: profile image, skills, experience, bio, social/web links.
- Allow profile creation and editing via Bootstrap 5 modals/forms.
- Add unit tests for user views, models, and forms.
- Protect user data and apply best security practices (CSRF, password validation, etc).

### Phase 4: Solution Posting, Editing, and Versioning

**Objective:** Enable users to post, edit, and transparently version-track solutions.

- Create the `Solution` model:
    - Fields: Title, markdown body, posted by (user), timestamps, tags (FK/M2M), version history.
- Integrate a markdown editor (such as django-markdownx or similar) with live preview.
- Implement solution editing with versioning:
    - Track changes between edits.
    - Present a history UI showing what changed over time.
- Support gist/code block embedding.
- Write views, forms, and templates for solution CRUD operations.
- Ensure all features are covered with unit tests and code quality checks.

### Phase 5: Collaborative Features — Comments, Ratings, Tagging, and Search

**Objective:** Foster collaboration through user ratings, comments, robust tagging, and powerful search.

- Implement commenting system:
    - Attach comments to solutions.
    - Allow threaded replies (optional: for future phase).
- Add ratings (upvote/downvote, or 5-star system) for solutions.
- Develop a flexible tagging system:
    - Tag solutions with language, framework, cloud environment, etc.
    - Autocomplete/tag suggestions for easy classification.
- Implement a search engine:
    - Simple: Django's built-in search and filtering.
    - Prepare for future AI-powered enhancements (search by relevance, summary, or recommendation).
- Add comprehensive model, view, and template tests.

### Phase 6: Deployment Readiness and GCP Integration

**Objective:** Prepare the site for production and cloud deployment.

- Finalize GitHub Actions config for CI/CD: test, build, and deploy to Google Cloud Platform.
- Write deployment scripts for GCP App Engine, Cloud Run, or similar.
- Ensure proper management of secrets, environment variables, and static/media files in GCP.
- Test deployment, monitoring, and rollback procedures.
- Final code audit and documentation update.

### Phase 7: Extensibility — AI, API, and Further Enhancements

**Objective:** Lay the groundwork for AI integrations and community features.

- Draft interfaces/services for Gemini AI features (summarization, recommendations, semantic search).
- Design RESTful API endpoints (Django REST Framework) for future mobile/apps.
- Document APIs and extension points.
- Plan for additional features: notifications, badges, moderation tools, etc.

## General Coding Standards

- **App Structure**: Each functional area is a dedicated Django app for modularity and scalability.
- **Template Design**: Use Django’s template inheritance; keep styling in centralized files; components as reusable
  partials.
- **Testing**: All business logic is covered by unittests and integration tests.
- **Code Quality**: All Python follows Black and flake8 standards; pre-commit hooks prevent sub-par code from entering
  the main branch.
- **Documentation**: Every phase must update `README.md` and in-line code docs for maintainability.
- **Open Source-Readiness**: Project is structured for easy collaboration and external contributions.

Use and adapt these detailed prompts for your coding agent one phase at a time, ensuring thorough planning, review, and
code quality at each step before advancing to the next development phase.
